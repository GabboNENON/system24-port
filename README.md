# system24-port (WIP)

A WIP fan-made system24 port for Discord's new UI. 

Aims to recreate system24 faithfully but with Refact0r's midnight theme variables and imports.

Uses [kanagawa.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim/tree/master) theme.

Please let me know if there are any missing/broken styles.

Contact me via discord: @Halides

I will do my best to try and patch any erroneous styles and am currently cleaning up the theme file for easier color customization.
